	   			<hr>
	   			<p>There’s a glut of workout apps available, but they mostly focus on metrics like calorie counting and weight. This can be frustrating for users who are making real progress, but not yet seeing results on the scale. Without seeing results, many will give up. GetSwole aims to solve this problem by measuring what’s important: gains in strength and endurance. With GetSwole, you'll be able to enter your own exercises, or choose from the basics provided and log them. When you want to see how far you’ve come, just click to see their progress represented in charts that keep you motivated.
